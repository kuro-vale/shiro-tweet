# shiro-tweet

Welcome to my React web app, this is the frontend of my backend app [kuro-tweet](https://github.com/kuro-vale/kuro-tweet),
I am cloning the Twitter(X) frontend and using it with also a clone of the backend in GraphQL for that I am using Apollo Client.

Most of the features of Twitter(X) are not implemented, I am not that crazy enough, but you can do the basics like

- Create a tweet
- Like a tweet
- Retweet
- Comment a tweet
- Feed of following users
- Search Tweets / Users
